Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
Introduction
Welcome to the Rock, Paper, Scissors Game project! This is a console-based implementation of the classic hand game where two players simultaneously form one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. The possible shapes are "rock", "paper", and "scissors". The winner is determined based on a set of predefined rules.

This project offers an interactive way to play Rock, Paper, Scissors, and serves as a practical coding exercise.
This is a simple implementation of the classic Hangman game written in HTML for structure, JavaScript for functionality, and CSS for styling.
________________

Description

Rock beats Scissor; Paper beats Rock; Scissor beats Paper.
