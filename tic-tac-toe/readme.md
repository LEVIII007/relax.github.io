##Description
Tic Tac Toe is a two-player game where one player is assigned 'X' and the other 'O'. The game is played on a 3x3 grid. The players take turns to mark their respective symbol in an empty cell within the grid. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all cells are filled and no player has achieved a winning combination, the game is a draw.<br>
