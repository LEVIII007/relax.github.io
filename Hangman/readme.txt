Hangman Game
Introduction
Welcome to the Hangman Game project! This is a simple yet entertaining command-line based implementation of the classic word guessing game. In Hangman, one player thinks of a word, and the other player tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of attempts.

This project is designed to provide a fun and interactive way to enjoy the Hangman game while also serving as a practical coding exercise.
This is a simple implementation of the classic Hangman game written in HTML for structure, JavaScript for functionality, and CSS for styling.
