Introduction
Welcome to the Etch-a-Sketch Project! This is a web-based implementation of the classic drawing toy, where you can create art by moving a cursor around a grid. This project is built using HTML for structure, JavaScript for functionality, and CSS for styling.

_______________
Features

*Multiple Colors: Allow users to select from a palette of colors to draw with, rather than just a single color.
*Line Thickness: Provide options for users to adjust the thickness of the lines they draw.
*Resizable Sketchpad: Allow users to resize the sketchpad to accommodate larger or smaller drawings.
*Eraser Tool: Include an eraser tool to erase specific parts of the drawing.
*Grid Overlay: Offer an option to toggle a grid overlay for more precise drawings.
*Fill Tool: Implement a fill tool to easily color enclosed areas.
